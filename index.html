        <h4>Fresh coat of paint</h4>
        <p>I recently bought the domain theriault.rocks and setup a redirect here for
          <a href="#">andy.theriault.rocks</a>. This reminded me how poor my colour choices were, so I fixed that!
        </p>

        <p>I think it looks much better. This also let me play with a few new CSS rules(to me), namely
          <i>clip-path</i>, and fix up a few others due to more familarity with
          <i>flex-box</i>. Boy do I ‚ù§Ô∏è&nbsp;
          <i>flex-box</i>, it makes everything just move into place, center middle aligned never felt so good.

        <h4>Healthcare, Blockchains, and a Hackathon</h4>
        <p>It's been a while! I've been busy working on a new Healthcare app for Careteam Technologies since October of 2016.
          This spring I bought in(literally) to the blockchain hype and most recently I participated in my first external
          hackathon.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let's start with the oldest news, I'm now working for
          <a href="https://careteam.tech">Careteam Technologies</a>. We are developing a healthcare app to help patients recover successfully by giving them
          tools to coordinate care with their personal network and access the information they need. This project has given
          me a chance to develop a green field project make impactful decisions. It's also exposed me to the world of extra
          privacy and security compliance from HIIPA and other regulations.
        </p>

        <p>
          Next up this spring, I first heard the whispers of Ethereum and cryptocurrencies. I had previously tried to work out how
          to mine Bitcoin but at the time I wasn't saavy enough to setup my GPU to earn those now $15,000+ coins. Flash forward
          to today, and when I heard about Ethereum and the latest surge of Bitcoin I decided it was good time to get in,
          which wasn't easy. At the time there was a big rush on new buyers trying to register with exchanges which lead
          to longer verification times. This compounded with the easy route Coinbase, being unable to process my credit card
          lead to a delayed departure to the üöÄ moon üöÄ.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lastly, I participated in my first external hackathon. It was put on by a local company
          <a href="https://bluzelle.com">Bluzelle</a>, who are building a distributed database product, the perfect solution for people build distributed
          apps(dApps). The theme was to build a dApp which could take advantage of their database. However their database
          wasn't ready for us to use during the hackathon, so our project was to build a prototype of it. In less than 2
          days. It didn't go so well. Our plan was to register ServiceWorkers to be used as nodes where we could push data
          to and retrieve a consensus from all the online nodes in the cluster. Unfortunately we were a very inexperienced
          team and couldn't demo a working app so we placed in the other-rans. I may pick up this project sometime in the
          future as I like ServiceWorkers and I think the concept has some possibilities.

        <h4>No more React</h4>
        <p>After coming back to post something here I realised my simple React version of this blog wasn't so easy to update...
        </p>
        <p>So I removed React and switched to a basic HTML/CSS/ES6, this has allowed me to practice a little more vanilla JS
          and play with CSS variables! If you're not familar with CSS variables check out
          <a href="https://css-tricks.com/difference-between-types-of-css-variables/">this article</a> from CSS-Tricks that covers the basics and a few cool demos. Of course these changes don't do
          anything for the ease of uploading, but at least I don't need to make sure I have all the node modules installed
          before I can even think of starting.
        </p>

        <p>This took away a lot of my motivation to build that MLB scoreboard I mention in the last post. Maybe next time...</p>

        <h4>Blog build tools</h4>
        <p>The plan after re-doing Photographic Memory was to move onto a larger project to test out some of the other tools
          that are being used in the
          <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank">ReactJS</a> world. However, I was side tracked by this site. I went to write about
          <a href="https://photographic.herokuapp.com">Photographic Memory 2.0</a>, add it to my
          <a href="/resume">Resume</a> and
          <a href="/portfolio">Portfolio</a> and wasn't satisfied with the process. So like anyone with a big rock I spent a few days reworking
          it to use React!</p>
        <p>To start this one I decided, based on my experience Googling, to use Webpack instead of Gulp to compile this project.
          Looking back I don't know if I've made the correct choice. I didn't have a great understanding of Gulp to begin
          with so now is the time to pick a tool and stick with it. Webpack seems to be the build tool of choice right now
          in the React community, and that certainly helped me get through setting up a working project. It wasn't an easy
          journey, but I got there with some help by reading a few blog posts. Special thanks to this one
          <a href="https://medium.com/@rajaraodv/webpack-the-confusing-parts-58712f8fcad9#.7805n6a4i" target="_blank">by Raja Rao</a> which pointed me in the right direction regarding this site's file structure. There's still some
          things I could do better like using the HTML plugin and templates instead of hand writing each of my two pages,
          or figuring how to point my CSS rules to the correct 'images' directory on build.</p>
        <p>After struggling with the Webpack, creating React components was easy and fast. I DRYed up my pages and I was able
          to extract the parts of my site into JSON objects, which are easier to update and require little boilerplate code.
          Overall it was good practice in writing simple React components and appreciating a simple application that has
          no state change.</p>
        <p>Up next, MLB scoreboard...</p>

        <h4>Photographic Memory updates</h4>
        <p>Recently I've been playing with
          <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">ReactJS</a>. I started my journey by finding a few tutorials to pick up the basics. Doing so I realised my Javascript
          skills were a little rusty, working mostly in Ruby at
          <a href="https://mybesthelper.com/" target="_blank">myBestHelper</a> and most of our Javascript is written in
          <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>. Familiarizing myself with vanilla JS allowed me to better follow along with the concepts and strength
          of ReactJS.</p>
        <p>Once the tutorials had done their job, I started to think about ways I could test my new skills. That led me to my
          favourite project I wrote at Lighthouse Labs,
          <a href="https://photographic-memory.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">Photographic Memory</a>! I always liked working on that project because the game was so fun to play. That is why
          I was so motivated to complete the game again. It was also the project where I wrote the most javascript.</p>
        <p>Reflecting on the project, I think I made a great choice. With so much state changing throughout the game I got a
          much better understanding of React component state, props and the React API. It also allowed me the chance to break
          my page into smaller and smaller components as I went along. I also got a chance to try my hand at ES6, Babel,
          and Gulp; more things I wasn"t very familar with before I started this.</p>
        <p>Check out the finished version
          <a href="https://photographic.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">here</a> or the repository
          <a href="https://github.com/terit/react-photographic-memory" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Up next I'm going to rewrite another Lighthouse Labs project, Rotten Mangoes. I think it's a good chance to try a
          more robust project with user accounts, multiple database models and a more complex application. It will also give
          me a chance to write a Node.js API server with the possibility of a universal/isomorphic refactor in the future.</p>
        <p>Stay tuned for more.</p>
